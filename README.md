# blogspot-domains

Get Blogspot domains from the CommonCrawl. Runs on Heroku.

To set the CommonCrawl index (base URL) to download from, you need to set the `index` environment variable: Example: `http://index.commoncrawl.org/CC-MAIN-2017-43-index-01`. A full list of indexes is available at https://index.commoncrawl.org/.

For the Google Drive feature at the end of the script, some authentication files are required:
`client_secrets.json` and `credentials.txt`
`client_secrets.json` can be downloaded from the Google API console from a project with the Google Drive enabled. Note that you will likely have to rename the file you download so it can be detected by the script.
`credentials.txt` can be generated by running the script locally and accepting the OAuth prompt.
